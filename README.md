<p><strong>ðŸŽ§ Soundcloud Player&nbsp;ðŸŽ§</strong></p>
<p>This is a project I worked on as a part of the <a href="https://onemonth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneMonth</a> JavaScript course. </p>
<p>This project taught me the fundamentals of integrating an API within a project and my first time integrating local storage.</p>
<p>What went well?</p>
<ul>
<li>It works! I'm happy with the basic functionality of the project: the music plays without issue and the playlist feature is useful.</li>
<li>Local Storage: I believe this a very useful feature for this project and also gives me a reference for using local storage in future projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>What could be improved?</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: I used a basic SemanticUI framework, but this could be improved on. Also, long-term I think it would be better to avoid using libraries in portfolio pieces.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
